Description: Implementations of several robust and non-parametric two-sample tests
    for the location problem under homoscedasticity as described in Fried & Dehling (2011) <doi:0.1007/s10260-011-0164-1>.
    The test statistics are based on robust location estimators to achieve robustness. 
    The p-values can be computed by the permutation principle, the randomization principle or, for large samples, by using
    the asymptotic distributions of the test statistics under the null hypothesis, which ensures
    (approximate) distribution independence of the test decision. Besides location shifts, the tests can also be used to test for scale changes
    between the underlying populations by a data transformation; see Fried (2012) <doi:10.1016/j.csda.2011.02.012>.
