Description: Implementation of several robust and non-parametric alternatives to
    the ordinary two-sample t-test for the location problem under
    homoscedasticity. The tests follow the construction idea of the t-test and
    use test statistics that consist of a robust estimator for the location
    difference which is standardized by a robust scale estimator. To achieve
    a non-parametric behaviour under the null hypothesis, a permutation
    principle is used. In addition, some hybrid tests are implemented that 
    combine several tests to derive a test decision.
