\arguments{
\item{x}{a (non-empty) numeric vector of data values.}

\item{y}{a (non-empty) numeric vector of data values.}

\item{alternative}{a character string specifying the alternative hypothesis,
must be one of "two.sided" (default), "greater" or "less".}

\item{delta}{a numeric value indicating the true difference in the location or scale parameter, depending
on whether the test should be performed for a difference in location or in scale, default is
\code{delta = 0} for location test and \code{delta = 1} for scale test.}

\item{method}{a character string specifying the test method used,
\code{"asymptotic"} for an asymptotic test based on the
normal distribution, \code{"permutation"} for a permutation and
\code{"randomization"} for a randomization test.
The permutation test uses all data splits into two samples,
while the randomization test draws \code{n.rep} random splits
with replacement.}

\item{scale}{a character string specifying the scale estimator used for standardization
of the test statistic, must be one of \code{"S1"} and \code{"S2"}.
Default is \code{"S1"}. Ignored if \code{method = "asymptotic"};
see details for definition of the scale estimators.}

\item{n.rep}{an integer value specifying the number of random splits used to
calculate the randomization distribution if \code{method = "randomization"},
ignored if \code{method = "permutation"} or \code{method = "asymptotic"};
default is \code{n.rep = 10000}.}

\item{na.rm}{logical value indicating whether NA values in x and y should be stripped before the computation proceeds.}

\item{var.test}{logical value testing whether the samples should be compared for a difference in scale.}

\item{wobble}{logical value indicating whether uniform noise should be added to the sample before
proceeding with the test, in order to make sure there are no duplicate values in the
sample that can cause the scale estimate to be 0. Only necessary for the permutation and
randomization version of the test. Defaults to FALSE.}
}
\value{
A list with class "\code{htest}" containing the following components:
\item{statistic}{the value of the test statistic.}
\item{p.value}{the p-value for the test.}
\item{estimate}{the estimated location difference based on the two-sample Hodges-Lehmann estimator.}
\item{null.value}{the specified hypothesized value of the mean difference.}
\item{alternative}{a character string describing the alternative hypothesis.}
\item{method}{a character string indicating what type of test was performed.}
\item{data.name}{a character string giving the names of the data.}
}
\description{
\code{hl2_test} performs a two-sample location test based on
the two-sample Hodges-Lehmann estimator for shift.
}
\details{
When computing a randomization distribution based on randomly drawn splits with replacement, the results of
Smyth & Phipson (2010) to calculate the p-value are used. The test statistics and the asymptotic distribution are taken from Fried & Dehling (2011).

 The test statistics for the permutation and randomization version of the test is standardized using a robust scale estimator.
\code{scale = "S1"} represents use of

\deqn{S = med(|X_i - X_j|: 1 \le i < j \le m, |Y_i - Y_j|, 1 <= i < j <= n),}

\code{scale = "S2"} uses

\deqn{S = med(|Z_i - Z_j|: 1 \le i < j \le m+n) }

where \eqn{ Z = ( X_1 - med(X),...,X_m - med(X), Y_1 - med(Y),...,Y_n - med(Y) )'}
is the median corrected sample. For more details see Fried & Dehling (2011).


For \code{var.test = TRUE}, the test compares the two samples for a difference in scale.
This is achieved by log-transforming the original observations so that a potential
scale difference appears as a location difference between the transformed samples;
see Fried (2012). The sample cannot contain zeros due to the necessary log-transformation.
If it contains zeros, uniform noise is added to all variables in order to remove zeros.
A warning is printed.
